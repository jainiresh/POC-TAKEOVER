# Node Rookout

[Rookout](https://rookout.com) is a Node.js package that supports
on the fly debugging and data extraction from Node.js applications
in production.

> Note: For the time being, NodeRook only supports protobuf 3.11, because in later versions the code is generated for browsers.

Installation:
```bash
npm install --save rookout
```

Setup:
```javascript
const rookout = require('rookout');

rookout.start({
    token: '[Your Rookout Token]'
});
```
